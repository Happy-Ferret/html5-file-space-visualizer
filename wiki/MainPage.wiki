= Introduction =

The HTML5 file space visualizer is a browser based package for graphically analyzing the space and layout of a file system.    An included java based program can be used to analyze a local file system and then load the data into a local web browser.   Javascript and HTML are then used to graph the layout and space usage of the file system in multiple ways.   D3.js adds animations and other fancy graphing capabilities.
